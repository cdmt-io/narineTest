* Hi, thanks for taking this test!

I'm looking to see what you know about CSS and Sass. Also React, Gatsby, and npm.

Please clone and install the project locally. You can get started with the "develop" command in package.json.

For this test, please help clean up the Sass code. The issue is regarding responsive design. I don't want to give too many details because I expect that a good designer should be able to spot the issue. Don't over think it either. This should only take a few minutes to complete.

When you're done, just check in your code and drop me a line. Thanks!
